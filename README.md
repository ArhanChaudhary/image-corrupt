# image-corrupt

Part my blog post [Turning Image Corruption into Art](https://arhan.sh/blog/turning-image-corruption-into-art/). A shell script that repeatedly corrupts an image and generates a video of it happening.

## Required software

- Python
- ImageMagick
- ffmpeg

Optionally, parallel

## Usage

./image_corrupt.sh [image_file]
```
